# Lab 9 - Repetition Control Structures (While Loop)

## Overview
This lab focuses on **repetition control structures in C++**, specifically the **`while` loop**.  
The goal is to understand how to perform repetitive tasks efficiently using loops and how to control the flow of repeated execution in a program.

## Lab Objectives
- Learn how to use **`while` loops** to execute a block of code multiple times.  
- Understand loop control conditions and how to prevent infinite loops.  
- Practice writing C++ programs that handle repetitive tasks dynamically.

## Lab Structure
- **Questions:** The lab tasks/questions are provided as images in this folder.  
- **Solutions:** Each task is solved in a separate `.cpp` file, named according to the task number (e.g., `task1.cpp`, `task2.cpp`).

## How to Use
1. Open the image(s) of the lab tasks to see the questions.  
2. Navigate to the corresponding solution file to see the C++ implementation.  <br>
