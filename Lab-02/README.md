# Lab 1-2 - Console Output and Escape Sequences

## Overview
This lab focuses on **displaying output on the console in C++** and **using escape sequences for formatting**.  
The goal is to understand how to display messages and data in a structured way and how to control text formatting using special characters.

## Lab Objectives
- Learn how to use **`cout`** to display text, numbers, and variables on the console.  
- Understand and implement **escape sequences** such as:
  - `\n` (newline)  
  - `\t` (tab)  
  - `\\` (backslash)  
  - `\"` (double quote)  
- Develop simple programs that output formatted text and data.

## Lab Structure
- **Questions:** The lab tasks/questions are provided as images in this folder.  
- **Solutions:** Each task is solved in a separate `.cpp` file, named according to the task number (e.g., `task1.cpp`, `task2.cpp`).

## How to Use
1. Open the image(s) of the lab tasks to see the questions.  
2. Navigate to the corresponding solution file to see the C++ implementation.  <br>
