# C++ Programming Exercises

This repository contains C++ programs for basic programming exercises, including calculations with variables, constants, and formatted output. Each folder corresponds to a specific task.

**TASK 1 – CALCULATING DISTANCE**<br>
Write a C++ program to calculate the squared distance between two points in a 2D plane using initialized values for coordinates.<br>
This exercise reinforces variable declaration and initialization in C++.

**Instructions:**<br>
- Initialize the coordinates `x1, y1` and `x2, y2` directly in the code as `double` variables.<br>
- Use the formula:  
  `squared_distance = (x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2`<br>
- Display the squared distance in the specified format.

**TASK 2 – TOTAL PURCHASE CALCULATION**<br>
A customer is buying five items in a store. The prices of these items are as follows:<br>
- Item 1: $12.95  
- Item 2: $24.95  
- Item 3: $6.95  
- Item 4: $14.95  
- Item 5: $3.95  
<br>
Write a C++ program that stores the prices of these five items in separate variables. The program should:<br>
- Display the price of each item individually.<br>
- Calculate and display the subtotal of the sale (sum of all items).<br>
- Calculate and display the sales tax (6% of the subtotal).<br>
- Display the total amount (subtotal plus sales tax).<br>

<br>**Notes:**<br>
- Use constants where appropriate (e.g., for the sales tax rate).<br>
- Use appropriate datatypes to store results and values in variables and constants.<br>
- This exercise focuses on understanding variables, constants, and datatypes.

**TASK 3 – AVERAGE OF PREDEFINED TEST SCORES ROUNDED TO TWO DECIMAL PLACES**<br>
Write a C++ program that calculates the average of three predefined test scores and displays the result rounded to two decimal places.<br>
- Initialize the test scores directly in the code.<br>
- After calculating the average, format the output to show exactly two decimal places for clarity.
