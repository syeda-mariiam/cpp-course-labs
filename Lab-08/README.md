# Lab 8 - Control Structures

## Overview
This lab focuses on **Control Structures in C++**, with a special emphasis on **decision control using the `switch` statement**.  
The goal is to understand how to control the flow of a program based on specific user inputs and make decisions efficiently.

## Lab Objectives
- Learn how to use **`switch` statements** to control program flow.  
- Understand how to handle multiple conditions without using multiple `if-else` statements.  
- Practice writing C++ programs that respond to user inputs dynamically.

## Lab Structure
- **Questions:** The lab tasks/questions are provided as images in this folder.  
- **Solutions:** Each task is solved in a separate `.cpp` file, named according to the task number (e.g., `task1.cpp`, `task2.cpp`).

## How to Use
1. Open the image(s) of the lab tasks to see the questions.  
2. Navigate to the corresponding solution file to see the C++ implementation.  <br>
